# gpt2-converse

![screenshot](./screenshot.png)


Use GPT-2 To try and simulate a conversation between a person and an immigration officer.
Topic chosen due to the fact that GPT-2 appears to be trained on a corpus of text that knows an
unusual amount about wars, famine, death, american politics, and the middle east.

We attempt to prime GPT-2 by setting up the "context" of the person who is being interviewed.
We then append the entire transcript and ask GPT-2 to continue the conversation.

# Results:

Mixed. sometimes it's very coherent, other times it's not as much....
